# responsive-css-starter-template
Gives you the core css breakpoints for beaver builder with a logical structure to begin applying mobile-first approach CSS

### Instructions
* Use the css file to provide a basic structure to your css code
* Approach css design with mobile first, designing as much as possible in the 'small & up' section
* Move to medium and up, and adjust anything that needs to make it look good on medium devices
* Move to the higher device sizes and again adjust anything that is needed to make it look good on larger devices.

* Where necessary, use the other areas such as 'small only' or 'medium & down' but be aware that this means all device sizes will process it regardless of if it's going to be used or not which may slow down load time.
